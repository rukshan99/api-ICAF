### Conference Management Tool
REST API is developed with Node.js and Express.js.

### 1. `git clone` - Clone the project
* `git clone https://github.com/rukshan99/api-ICAF`
* Add the `.env` file inside the root folder with `MONGO_DB_PASSWORD`.
### 2. `npm install` - Install the required packages

### 3. `npm start` - Run the server in development mode

### Best practices
* Before starting development, create a branch.
  * `git checkout -b <FTR|ENH|BUG-name>`
* Stage and commit changes to the local repo.
  * `git add .`
  * `git commit -m "<commit message>"`
* Push to the new remote branch.
  * `git push -u origin <FTR|ENH|BUG-name>` (for first push to origin)
